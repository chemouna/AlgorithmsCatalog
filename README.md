Inspired by the [website](https://wiki.algo.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main_Page) and [Writing correct code, part 3: preconditions and postconditions]
(https://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/writing-correct-code-part-3-preconditions-and-postconditions-binary-search-part-4c/) this is an attempt to 
catalog algorithms by the general problems they solve and describe them in a more clear and formal way 
with their invariants, preconditions and postconditions and the example of problems they solve.

I will for each general algorithm try to provide a little bit more formal description, and describe how to identify 
how a problem is solved by it.

Note: This is still very much in progress and not polished at all yet.

## Search Algorithms

### Binary Search

#### Pseudo code 
Given an array A of n elements with values or records A0 ... An−1, sorted such that A0 ≤ ... ≤ An−1, 
and target value T, find the index of T in A.

1/ Set L to 0 and R to n − 1.
2/ If L > R, the search terminates as unsuccessful.
3/ Set m (the position of the middle element) to the floor (the largest previous integer) of (L + R) / 2.
4/ If Am < T, set L to m + 1 and go to step 2.
5/ If Am > T, set R to m – 1 and go to step 2.
6/ Now Am = T, the search is done; return m.

## Data Structures 

### Linear Data Structures 

#### Array

#### Bit Array

### Circular Buffer 

### Disjoint-set data structure

#### Disjoint-set forests 

#### Path compression 

#### Invariants 
head == tail  iff buffer is empty (this invariant is only valid in the method of implementation where the wrap-around goes back to 0).
If buffer is not empty, head points at next valid element to be consumed.
tail always points at the next empty element.
    => There is always one unused element in a full buffer.
     => length must be greater than 1
            
#### Implementation 

- One less common but better implementation:
circular buffer implementation needs only head and tail indices. `size'
above appears to be redundant.

Implementation-wise, the head and tail indices should *not* be constrained
to be less than the size of the buffer. They should be allowed to wrap all
the way back to zero. This allows you to distinguish between the
completely-empty and completely-full states while using 100% of the storage.
