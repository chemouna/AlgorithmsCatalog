Inspired by the [website](https://wiki.algo.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main_Page) and [Writing correct code, part 3: preconditions and postconditions]
(https://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/writing-correct-code-part-3-preconditions-and-postconditions-binary-search-part-4c/) this is an attempt to 
catalog algorithms by the general problems they solve and describe them in a more clear and formal way 
with their invariants, preconditions and postconditions and the example of problems they solve.

I will for each general algorithm try to provide a little bit more formal description, and describe how to identify 
how a problem is solved by it.
