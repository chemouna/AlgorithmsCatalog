# Primes 

## Prime number
A natural number is a prime number if it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself. 

## Composite number
A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.

## Coprime numbers
Coprime numbers are a set of integers that have no common divisor other than 1 or -1.
 
## The fundamental theorem of arithmetic
every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime factors.
Primes can thus be considered the “basic building blocks” of the natural numbers
