## Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)
- a cut vertex is any vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components. 

## Bridge (Cut edge)
- is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases its number of connected components.[1] Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. 
- A graph with n nodes can contain at most {\displaystyle n-1} n-1 bridges, since adding additional edges must create a cycle. The graphs with exactly n-1 bridges are 
  exactly the trees, and the graphs in which every edge is a bridge are exactly the forests.
