## Derangment
derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position, derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.

For example, the only two derangements of the three items (0, 1, 2) are (1, 2, 0), and (2, 0, 1).
The number of derangements of n distinct items is known as the subfactorial of n, sometimes written as !n. 

### Subfactorial
The nth subfactorial (also called the derangement number) is the number of permutations of n objects in which no object appears in its natural place.

The first few values of !n for n=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 2, 9, 44, 265, 1854, 14833, ... . For example, the only derangements of {1,2,3} are {2,3,1} and {3,1,2}, so !3=2.
