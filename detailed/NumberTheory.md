## Finding the Last Digit of a Power

 
### Methods 

#### Using Modular Arithmetic
- Finding the last digit of a positive integer is the same as finding the remainder of that number when divided by n. 
- In general, the last digit of a power in base n is its remainder upon division by n 
  finding the last n digits amounts to computation mod 10^n. 

### Using Chinese Remainder Theorem
- find a number mod 5^n and mod 2^n and then combine those results, using the Chinese remainder theorem, to find that number mod 10^n.

### Using Euler's Theorem 
- Large exponents can be reduced by using Euler's theorem: if gcd(a,n) = 1 and Phi(n) denotes Euler's totient function, then
    a^phi(n) = 1 (mod n)
