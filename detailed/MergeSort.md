# Merge Sort


## Algorithm
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
- Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list


## Q/A

* Q: Is quicksort better than mergesort?
  A: Merge sort complexity is O(n log n) on both the average and worst case 
     Quick sort complexity is O(n log n) on the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case 

* Q: The point when the time/space complexity for a merge sort would be as good/bad as an insertion sort for given values ? 
  A:
