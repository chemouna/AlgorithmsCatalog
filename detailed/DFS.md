## DFS Forests 

- A DFS starting at some vertex v explores the graph by building up a tree that contains all vertices that are reachable from v and all edges that are used to reach these vertices. 
  We call this tree a DFS tree. A complete DFS exploring the full graph (and not only the part reachable from a given vertex v) builds up a collection of trees, or forest, 
  called a DFS forest.
